what i will be doing is reading the book
and at times check on the videos

ep 1
the sequel to this book?

Alan J Perlis
"Epigrams on Programming"
"its bettter to have 100 functions
 operate on one ds ...."
 APL: A language for lyrical programmign

learning algorithms is very important

python flavor lisp looks interesting

talks about applicative order and normal order

ep 2
"tech" podcast list

should i listen to them?

interesting solution for the
factorial thing
would have probably done the samething
on haskell
fact x = foldl (*) 1 [1..x]

16:50

this (threading ~>) looks interesting

Because i quit the book i also quit this. but this looks much more digestible so
you should maybe venture here instead first before book
